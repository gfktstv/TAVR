A significant number of cars can be seen on the roads these days contributing to air pollution by releasing dangerous gases into the surroundings. Another factor responsible is the widespread industrialization. The factories produce poisonous chemicals during the manufacturing process of products. For example, in order to generate energy, fossil fuels are burnt which emits carbon dioxide and mix in the air. Also, forestland is converted into industries which further increases the pollution to a greater extent.

Considering the effects, there is a severe impact of this on the environment. There is a considerable rise in the heat on the earth which gives rise to global warming.

Moreover, it poses a serious threat to living beings which could lead to health ailments such as lung cancer, kidney problems and other chronic diseases.

To sum up, usage of automobiles and growing number of industries are the causes and effects are felt in terms of environment and individual suffering.
